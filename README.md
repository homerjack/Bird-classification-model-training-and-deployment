# Training of image classification model with android application deployment

### Summary

This is an assignment for a school project in which an image classification model for local bird species was trained, and subsequently deployed to an android application. The full list of bird species can be found in the labels.txt file in the repository.

This android application was built using android studio, and is built up from the [Tensorflow examples on image classification,] (https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android) as well as the image classifier by [Michael Shea.] (https://github.com/soum-io/TensorFlowLiteInceptionTutorial)

The NASNetMobile classification models used were created via transfer learning, using images from a school assignment. However, the images displayed in the app are only from the [Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset.] (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html)

The features of the app (such as fragments, scrollview) are largely adopted from youtube tutorials, in particular from [Coding in Flow.] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Fh8kvtkVPkeihBs42jGcA)
